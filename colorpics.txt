 In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white (half-
tones), and only in exceptional cases, and if
the author or the conference organization
is prepared to cover the extra costs involve
d, are colored pictures accepted. Colored
pictures are welcome in the electronic ve
rsion free of charge. If you send colored
figures that are to be printed in black and
white, please make sure that they really are
also legible in black and white. Some colors show up very poorly when printed in
black and white.
